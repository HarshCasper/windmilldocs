We are **FULLY REMOTE** forever but we will organize offsites on a regular

quarter.

### Head of BD & Sales

windmill.dev is a SaaS that can be sold not only to individual and teams but
also to enterprises, either as self-hostable software or hosted on our cloud.
You own the relationship with those companies, including the sales process and
the acquisition funnel.

Furthermore, windmill.dev can potentially grow as a tool for consultancy shops
or as a consultancy itself for automations, it is a plus if you are interested
or have related experience.

### Founding Solutions Engineer

windmill.dev is first and foremost a tool for automations. As a solutions
engineer you will unlock values for customers by leveraging the product in
optimal ways for their specific cases. You will work directly with somes
companies and unlock value for all by creating great templates, snippets and
integrations in a public and open-source manner.

### Founding Software Engineer

In addition to being a SaaS business, windmill.dev represents a most exciting
technical challenge. We are a small but mighty team and we compete with the
likes of giants. As such, we need to make fast-paced, iterative and sustainable
software design choices. You can find more information about our architecture in
the documentation but overall windmill.dev is a highly available compute
providers, built with rust, postgres, microvms (firecracker) and svelte for the
frontend. You will work autonomously as an engineer to make windmill.dev a
delightful, scalable and performant product.

### Founding DevOps Engineer

A large part of windmill.dev business is its hosted SaaS part which implies that
we must ensure high availability in the software and the infrastructure choices
that we make and in the SLA that we offers. As a founding DevOps engineer, you
will ensure that we make the right choices in terms of observability, incident
responses, software design, high-availability and infrastructure. windmill.dev's
current archtiecture design is stateless replicated rust servers backed by
postgres instances sharded by workspaces id. We use Hetzner Cloud for cost
purposes and run on top of nomad for deployment state management.

### CEO right hand

windmill.dev is its infancy and the CEO does a bit of everything. Since we
cannot clone him yet and a day only has 24h you will assist him in all
applicable tasks.

## The hiring process

1. You send an email at hiring@windmill.dev with all the information you deem
   useful about you.
2. You will receive an answer in 24h, an invite for a 30min or 1h chat.
3. We iterate until we both see a mutual fit

## "Co-founder" and "Head of" positions?

Some positions mention either "Head of" or "Co-founder". Being an Head of or
Co-founder implies significantly more responsibility, expectations and
commitment, as well as more equity incentives. The mentions means that those
positions either lead quickly to that role if desired regardless of past
experience, or given an immediate and extra-ordinary fit, you could start right
away with that commitment. Co-founder or not, as an early joiner and founding
member, you will necessarily scale the team and shape it to your mold!

## Equity

The equity grant is generous and vested over 4 years with a cliff of 6 months
which is also the end of the trial period. It is granted as stock options or
BSPCE if applicable.

## Salary

We offer competitive salaries.
